Written description of three observable trends based on the data
1. Majority of players that purchased items are male by a significant margin at 83%.
2. Many of the most popular items for sale were the same as the most profitable items due to prices being fairly similiar across the board.
3. The customers with age ranges between 15 and 29 are most likely to spend the most due to a high purchase count. Majority of future innovative products should be catered to them.
4. If management were to ask about where we can improve business, I would recommend targeting the age group of 15-19 initially. Retention of these customers through the age of 29 can be solved using other data.
